                I am a dual major in Television/Radio/Film in <strong>Newhouse</strong> and Information Management and Technology with a concentration in data analytics in the <strong>iSchool</strong>. I decided to be a dual major because I wanted to be able to use data analytics skills in the entertainment industry.

                This past summer, I interned at <strong>HBO</strong> on the Content Strategy team. My tasks mainly focused on competitive analysis for the 6 major streamers. This was a great experience for me as it taught me a lot about the entertainment industry first-hand, not simply through a textbook. At the time, the company was going through a huge merger, so it was super beneficial to see how a company transitions through something like that. At <strong>Syracuse University</strong>, I have been part of the honors program since freshman year and I am a peer mentor for the first-year students. My strongest skills are time management, organization, attention to detail, and independence.

                Outside of work, I really enjoy cooking or finding delicious restaurants. I believe that food can bring people together in a way that nothing else can. Whether it is a group of people bonding and cooking together or sharing a take-out meal, food creates an experience for people to find common ground.
                Other hobbies include:

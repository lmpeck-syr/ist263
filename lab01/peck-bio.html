    <body>
        I am a dual major in Television/Radio/Film in Newhouse and Information Management & Technology with a concentration in data analytics in the iSchool. I decided to be a dual major because I wanted to be able to use data analytics skills in the entertainment industry.

        This past summer, I interned at HBO on the Content Strategy team. My tasks mainly focused on competitive analysis for the 6 major streamers. This was a great experience for me as it taught me a lot about the entertainment industry first-hand, not simply through a textbook. At the time, the company was going through a huge merger, so it was super beneficial to see how a company transitions through something like that. At Syracuse University, I have been part of the honors program since freshman year and I am a peer mentor for the first-year students. My strongest skills are time management, organization, attention to detail, and independence. 

        Outside of work, I really enjoy cooking or finding delicious restaurants. I believe that food can bring people together in a way that nothing else can. Whether it is a group of people bonding and cooking together or sharing a take-out meal, food creates an experience for people to find common ground. Additionally, I enjoy listening to music, binge watching reality T.V. series, and watching movies with my friends.
